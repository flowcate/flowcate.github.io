ISO-24730 Adapter
=================

The ISO-24730 Adapter enables the DeepHubÂ® to be integrated with ISO-24730-capable real-time locating systems. The ISO-24730 standard was created in the mid 2000s and revised in 2014. It is supported by
several real-time locating systems e.g. utilizing ultra-wideband technology.

The standard consists of several air interface protocols as well as a single API called "RTLS API". It is the latter, that the DeepHub supports and that is subject of this configuration documentation.


Setup and Configuration
-----------------------

A DeepHub can be configured to work together with several ISO-24739 locating systems at the same time, each one of them being treated as a separate zone.

The DeepHub acts as a client towards a configured ISO-24730 service of an ISO-24730 locating system and therefore requires a separate configuration block consisting of the host, port, type of locating system as well as an identifier for the zone (zone_id or foreign_id) for each of them.

*Example:*

.. code-block:: yaml

  - host: server
    port: 4000
    type: uwb
    zone_id: FDE56BB8-64B1-4B95-ADEB-AB189EE937FE
  - host: otherserver
    port: 4000
    type: gps
    foreign_id: some_id


An ISO-24730 configuration can be provided in the same way as other configuration parameters. See the chapter :ref:`Server Configuration <deep-hub-install-server-configuration>` for details.
