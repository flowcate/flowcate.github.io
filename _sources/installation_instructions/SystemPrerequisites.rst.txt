System Prerequisites
====================

.. _system-pre-requisites_docker:

Docker
------

Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises.
Docker image containers can run natively on Linux and Windows. Developers can use development environments on Windows, Linux, or macOS. On the development computer, the developer may run a Docker host where Docker images are deployed.

- Image : A Docker image is a file, comprised of multiple layers, that is used to execute code in a Docker container. It is a package that contains all necessary files for a containerized application to run. When the Docker user runs an image, it can become one or multiple instances of the container.

- Container : An instance of a Docker image. A container represents the execution of a single application, process, or service. It consists of the contents of a Docker image, an execution environment, and a standard set of instructions.

- Docker Compose : A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Based on your operating system, you can download and install Docker Desktop here: `Docker Desktop <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/>`_.
While installing Docker on your machine, ensure you allow the installation to bypass any firewall settings (if prompted). Once the installation process is complete, your machine will restart.

.. note:: When Docker Desktop is installed on Windows, the entire package is installed (including the Docker Compose). With Ubuntu, the user needs to install Docker and the Docker Compose separately.

.. _system-pre-requisites_windows:

Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt
------------------------------------

A shell is a user interface that gives you access to various services of an operating system.
A shell can be command-line based, or it can include a graphical user interface (GUI).
Windows PowerShell is a shell developed by Microsoft for task automation and configuration management.
It is cross-platform and consists of a command-line shell and scripting language.
PowerShell capabilities allow users to simplify and automate repetitive tasks by creating scripts and combining multiple commands.
The Windows operating system comes with Windows PowerShell pre-installed. However, Windows PowerShell can be installed for other operating systems here: `Windows PowerShell <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7>`_.
Aside from Windows PowerShell, the classic Windows Command Prompt is also pre-installed and can be used for tasks at hand.

Terminal for Linux & macOS
--------------------------

A terminal is a program that allows the use of the command-line in a graphical environment.
In a Linux system, the shell is a command-line interface that interprets a user’s commands and script files, and notifies the server’s operating system what to do with them.
Terminal is pre-installed on Linux and macOS. For more information, please read   `Ubuntu Tutorials <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview>`_.
