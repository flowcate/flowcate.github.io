Install Specific Version
========================

It is possible to switch to a specific version of the DeepHub® instead of the latest one, if required.

.. note:: Before installing a specific version of the DeepHub®, it is mandatory to stop a running hub as described previously in the :ref:`stop_a_running_deephub` section of the :ref:`docker compose <deep-hub-install-docker-compose>` chapter of this guide.

Pulling Specific Containers
---------------------------

Open the “docker-compose.yml” file. Edit the version of the DeepHub® from “latest” to the desired version. For example, it can be modified from "latest" to “1.1.6”.
Similarly, the version of DeepHub® UI can be adapted accordingly.

Now, the specified version is pulled when executing the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

  docker-compose pull


To start the pulled version, use the typical command as described in section :ref:`start_a_deephub` of the :ref:`docker compose <deep-hub-install-docker-compose>` chapter.
