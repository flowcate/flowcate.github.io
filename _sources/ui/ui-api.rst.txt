"API" of the DeepHub UI
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The DeepHub UI offers several URL parameters to customize the **Live View**.

Pan & Zoom to a specific location by specifying:

* **lng**: the longitude to which the map should pan.
* **lat**: the latitude to which the map should pan.
* **zoom**: the zoom level. Must be in the range [0,16], where 0 corresponds to a zoomed out view of the globe, and 16 corresponds to a detailed, zoomed in view. For more information, refer to MapTiler - our default mapping service provider: `Tiles Ã  la Google Maps <https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/>`_.

OR:

* **id**: pan & zoom to the last known location of a **trackable or location provider** with the given id(s). If several ids are provided, they must be comma-separated.
* **filterid**: only render **trackables and location providers** with the given id(s). If several ids are provided, they must be comma-separated. 

Examples:

.. code-block::

  /map/system/live?lng=9.5367&lat=49.4055&zoom=9

  or

  /map/system/live?id=d49f0712-dcbd-4cbc-8b4f-c006b8555839
