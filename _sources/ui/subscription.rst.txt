Within the DeepHubÂ® UI, there is a section called "License Information" that includes relevant details related to the license/subscription of your DeepHub instance. 

To access this menu, click the gear icon at the top right corner of the UI to open the Configuration menu. Click on "Subscription".

The "License Information" page provides administrative information, such as the license type (Trial, Development, Production), customer email, a link to request a license key if needed, and a text box to enter and apply a license key. If the DeepHub instance has an active trial license, the end date and time of the trial period will be shown here as well.
