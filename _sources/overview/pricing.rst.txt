Pricing Model
-------------

The pricing model of the DeepHubÂ® is subscription-based. For each end-customer and project, you acquire a subscription with the necessary features and capabilities to build your tailored solution.

You may deploy a DeepHub instance on-premise at your customer's site, or operate and maintain it yourself - this is entirely up to you.

Our DeepHub is also available as a white label product if your intention is for product bundling.

Subscriptions are purely entity-based, however we also offer consumption-based pricing models as part of individual contracts.
