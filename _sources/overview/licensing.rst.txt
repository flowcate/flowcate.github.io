License Mechanism
-----------------

.. card:: The DeepHubÂ® comes with a simple license mechanism:
   :img-bottom: images/licensing_technical.svg

   * Once a day, the DeepHub sends consumption and usage statistics to a *Flowcate License Server* on SSL/HTTPS port 443 and gets a "lease" back in response.

   * The latter contains all necessary information for the DeepHub, including when to contact the license server again.

   * This mechanism is always in place, regardless of whether you have an industrial-grade production system or a first trial installation.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The configuration of a DeepHub with this license mechanism is straightforward:

For every subscription, you will receive a trial license key, a development license key, and a production license key. These would have to be defined in the DeepHub configuration.
