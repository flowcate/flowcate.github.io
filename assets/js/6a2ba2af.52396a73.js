These devices typically have an embedded Android smartphone, therefore the DeepHub Kiosk UI can run on them out-of-the-box. Conveniently, the Kiosk UI now includes barcode scanning functionality as well. Scan a barcode and if an asset, A.K.A a trackable, is not found,\nsimply create one with one tap of your finger. Now let's consider that you invested into a locating system but don't want to attach a tag to each asset because that would be costly (assuming you have thousands of assets in your warehouse). Instead, just have every worker wear a tag while working in the warehouse. Within the Kiosk UI,\na tag, A.K.A a location provider, can be paired with our Kiosk UI instance, ensuring the position of the worker's tag becomes the position of the Kiosk UI. When a barcode is\nscanned, the position of your device can be used and associated with the scanned asset, ensuring the asset gets a location. That's it. With just a handful of tags for\nyour workers, all your assets can be tracked."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},11151:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i,a:()=>r});var a=n(67294);const s={},o=a.createContext(s);function r(e){const t=a.useContext(o);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:r(e.components),a.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
